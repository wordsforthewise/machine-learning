For example, you could split based on number of abscences: if the number of absences is greater than 10, those students go into one group, and if the absences are less than or equal to 10, they go in another group.  These subgroups are then further split in a similar way, using other characteristics of the students.  This method is called a decision tree.  However, it tends to overfit the data, meaning it predicts the data well that we trained it on, but doesn't do as well with predicting new things.  One way around this is to use a collection of decision trees trained on subsets of the overall data."
